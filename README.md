# Simulation-Methods-of-Stochastic-System
Eight projects are completed by programming using Matlab.  
1.The topic of first project is Probability conception and data presentation.  
2.The topic of second project is bootstrap confidence interval and accetp-reject sampling.  
3.The topic of third project is statistic testing under different distributions.  
4.The topic of fourth project is Monte Carlo simulation and empirical distribution function.  
5.The topic of fifth project is Non-homogeneous Poisson process and discrete events.  
6.The topic of sixth project is alpha-stable distribution and Chambers-mallows-Stuck method.  
7.The topic of seventh project is Bayesian iterative learning process, expectation maximization algorithm, multivariate Gaussian distribution and K-means clustering method.  
8.The topic of eighth project is MCMC, Gibbs sampling, simulated annealing and Schwefel function.
